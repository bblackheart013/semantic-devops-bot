This could be due to a typo in the resource group name, the resource group being deleted, or the deployment being pointed to the wrong cloud account or region.\", 'severity': '- ****\\nMedium. While the error prevents the deployment from proceeding, it is not indicative of a system-wide failure or data loss. However, it does block the deployment process, which could delay application updates or releases.', 'recommended_solution': \"- ****\\n1. **Verify Resource Group Name:** Double-check the spelling and case sensitivity of 'my-resource-group' in your deployment scripts or configuration files.\\n2. **Check Resource Group Existence:** Log into your cloud provider's portal (e.g., Azure Portal) and verify that the resource group exists in the expected subscription and region.\\n3. **Correct Subscription/Region:** Ensure that your Kubernetes deployment is targeting the correct subscription and region where the resource group is located.\\n4. **Update Configuration:** If the resource group has been renamed or moved, update your deployment configuration to reflect the current resource group name.\\n5. **Re-run Deployment:** After making the necessary corrections, attempt to redeploy.\", 'prevention': '- ****\\n- **Use Environment Variables:** Store resource group names and other critical configuration details in environment variables or configuration management tools to avoid hardcoding them in scripts.\\n- **Automated Checks:** Implement automated checks or scripts that verify the existence of critical resources before deployment.\\n- **Documentation and Naming Conventions:** Maintain clear documentation and consistent naming conventions for resource groups and other cloud resources to minimize errors.\\n- **Access Control:** Regularly audit and manage access permissions to ensure that only authorized personnel can modify or delete critical resources.', 'severity_level': 'MEDIUM'}",
