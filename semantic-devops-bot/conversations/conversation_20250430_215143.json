The message suggests that the repository `myapp/image` is either not available publicly or the user does not have the necessary permissions to access it.', 'severity': '- ****\\nMedium. This issue prevents the application from being deployed or run if the image is essential.

You will need your Docker Hub credentials or credentials for the private registry.\\n- If using a private registry, ensure you specify the registry URL during login, e.g., `docker login myregistrydomain.com`.\\n3. **Check Repository Access:**\\n- Ensure that the repository `myapp/image` exists and that your account has the necessary permissions to access it.\\n- If the repository is private, confirm that your account is added as a collaborator or has the appropriate access rights.\\n4. **Pull the Image Again:** After authentication and verification, attempt to pull the image again using `docker pull myapp/image`.', 'prevention': '- ****\\n- **Maintain Access Credentials:** Regularly update and securely store your Docker registry credentials to avoid authentication issues.\\n- **Repository Management:** Ensure that all necessary team members have access to required repositories and that repository names are consistently used across environments.\\n- **Automated Authentication:** For CI/CD pipelines, use Docker secrets or environment variables to manage authentication credentials securely.\\n- **Documentation:** Keep documentation up to date regarding which images are private and require authentication, and ensure team members are aware of these requirements.', 'severity_level': 'MEDIUM'}",
